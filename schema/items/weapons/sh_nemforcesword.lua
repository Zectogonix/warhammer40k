Force Swords are crafted using arcane magicks and complex scientific formulae and incorporate a power field that is enhanced by the psychic strength of its wielder like all Nemesis Force Weapons. Its balanced grips and nearly indestructible construction makes it the perfect weapon for parrying the attacks of even the most powerful daemonic foe."
