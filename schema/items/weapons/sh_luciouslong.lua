ITEM.name = "Lucius Pattern Hellgun"
ITEM.description = "Sometimes known as a Hellgun, this hot-shot weapon's power pack operates at a higher charge than many other more common patterns of the Lasgun used by other Imperial Guard regiments. This gives the weapon more penetrating power, but drains the power pack after only 25 shots. This specific variant is a modification of the standard rifle made by the Death Korps of Krieg."
